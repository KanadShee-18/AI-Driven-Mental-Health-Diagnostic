## Points to Be follows before starting:

> `NOTE:` Make sure `python` is installed inside your system

If not, then refer to this youtube video:
[Video Link](https://youtu.be/UvyWKHh3BcY?si=oDx3I2VlvFfT8_RF)

- Verify the installation by running this command in your `terminal/powershell`:

```bash
Python --verison
```

---

## Staring Point:

> Clone this Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KanadShee-18/AI-Driven-Mental-Health-Diagnostic.git
```

> Go inside the directory.

> Open your favourite code editor. (for me its VsCode)

> Now, open `terminal/powershell`, and run

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

- then, activate the scripts inside `venv`, by running:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- Now, install all the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Now, after successfull installation, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

Thanks in Advance
